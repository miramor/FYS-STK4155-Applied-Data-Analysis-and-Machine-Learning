# FYS-STK4155 Applied Data Analysis and Machine Learning.  
Repository of collaborative coursework for FYS-STK4155 Applied Data Analysis and Machine Learning at the University of Oslo. The course covers central algorithms and methods essential for studies of statistical data analysis and machine learning. There are a total of three projects, which are outlined below. Each project folder contains the source code and a report.


## Projects
### [Project 1](https://github.com/miramor/FYS-STK4155-Applied-Data-Analysis-and-Machine-Learning/tree/main/Project1): Regression Analysis and Resampling Methods
In this project we run Ordinary Least Squares, Ridge Regression and Lasso Regression on the Franke Function and Terrain Data.

### [Project 2](https://github.com/miramor/FYS-STK4155-Applied-Data-Analysis-and-Machine-Learning/tree/main/Project2): Classification and Regression, from Linear and Logistic Regression to Neural Networks
In this project we have made our own implementation of stochastic gradient descent (SGD), feed forward neural network and logsitic reggresion, both of which use SGD.

### [Project 3](https://github.com/miramor/FYS-STK4155-Applied-Data-Analysis-and-Machine-Learning/tree/main/Project3): Water Quality Predicition
In this project we predict the water-potabilty given a binary classification dataset. The predictions are done by implementing a feed forward neural network, decision tree, decision tree with bagging, boosting and random forest.

#### [Extra Project](https://github.com/miramor/FYS-STK4155-Applied-Data-Analysis-and-Machine-Learning/tree/main/ExtraProject): Bias-Variance Tradeoff Analysis 
Conducting a bias-variance tradeoff analysis on terrain data from Norway
